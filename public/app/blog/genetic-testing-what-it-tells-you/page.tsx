            There is a version of genetic testing that sounds like fortune-telling.
            Spit in a tube. Get a report. Learn your destiny.

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            That is not how it works. And when people expect prophecy, they either over-react to the results or dismiss them entirely.

            <strong className="text-sfm-navy">Genetic testing, used correctly, is not about predicting the future. It is about adding context to the present.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-sfm-navy mt-12 mb-6">What Genetics Can Clarify</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Your genes do not tell you what will happen. They tell you what might be more likely to happen, given certain conditions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">That distinction matters.</p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            A genetic variant associated with cardiovascular disease does not mean you will have a heart attack. It means that the standard advice to &ldquo;watch your cholesterol&rdquo; might be more urgent for you than for someone without that variant. It means your threshold for intervention might be lower. It means your clinician should be paying closer attention, earlier.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong className="text-sfm-navy">Genetics helps explain:</strong></p>

          <ul className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-8 space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Why disease sometimes appears earlier than expected</li>
            <li>Why certain medications cause side effects in some people and not others</li>
            <li>Why standard treatments work unevenly across patients</li>
            <li>Why family history matters even when labs look normal</li>
            <li>Why two people with identical lifestyles can have different outcomes</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 bg-sfm-cream/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-sfm-gold">
            <strong className="text-sfm-navy">It is not destiny. It is dimensionality.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-sfm-navy mt-12 mb-6">A Case Where Testing Changed the Approach</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I had a patient in his early fifties. No major health issues. Exercised regularly. Ate reasonably well. His labs were unremarkable year after year.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            But his father had died of a heart attack at 58. His uncle had a stroke at 61. The family pattern was hard to ignore.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Standard risk calculators said he was low risk. The math did not account for what his family had already shown him.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We did targeted genetic testing. It revealed a variant associated with elevated lipoprotein(a), a cardiovascular risk factor that standard lipid panels do not measure directly and that does not respond to lifestyle changes.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Knowing this changed everything. Not because he was doomed, but because we could act with precision instead of guessing. Earlier imaging. Appropriate medication. A plan that matched his actual risk, not the population average.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 bg-sfm-cream/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-sfm-gold">
            <strong className="text-sfm-navy">He is not a statistic. He is a person with a specific biology. The testing helped us treat him that way.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-sfm-navy mt-12 mb-6">When Genetic Testing Makes Sense</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Genetic testing is not something I recommend for everyone. It adds value when it meaningfully changes decisions.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong className="text-sfm-navy">That typically includes:</strong></p>

          <ul className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-8 space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Strong family history of early disease (cardiovascular, cancer, neurological)</li>
            <li>Unexpected medication reactions or failures</li>
            <li>Ambiguous symptoms that do not fit a clear pattern</li>
            <li>Patients who want to move from reactive care to <Link href="/services/what-we-cover" className="text-sfm-azure hover:text-sfm-navy underline underline-offset-2 transition-colors">precision prevention</Link></li>
            <li>Situations where standard risk tools seem to underestimate true risk</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 bg-sfm-cream/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-sfm-gold">
            <strong className="text-sfm-navy">Testing without context is just data. Testing within a <Link href="/about" className="text-sfm-azure hover:text-sfm-navy underline underline-offset-2 transition-colors">continuous care relationship</Link> becomes actionable intelligence.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-sfm-navy mt-12 mb-6">When It Does Not Help</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong className="text-sfm-navy"><Link href="/services/what-we-cover" className="text-sfm-azure hover:text-sfm-navy underline underline-offset-2 transition-colors">Genetic testing</Link> is not useful when:</strong></p>

          <ul className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-8 space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>There is no plan to act on the results</li>
            <li>The findings would not change clinical management</li>
            <li>It is driven by anxiety rather than clinical reasoning</li>
            <li>It replaces rather than complements the basics (lifestyle, labs, physical exam, history)</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Genetics is a layer. It is not a shortcut. And it is not a substitute for the fundamentals of good care.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-sfm-navy mt-12 mb-6">The Risk of Testing Outside a Relationship</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Direct-to-consumer genetic tests are widely available now. Some of them are reasonably accurate. But accuracy is not the same as usefulness.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Without clinical interpretation, results can mislead. A &ldquo;risk variant&rdquo; sounds terrifying until you understand its actual penetrance. A &ldquo;normal&rdquo; result sounds reassuring until you realize the test only covered a fraction of relevant genes.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Genetic data without context creates noise. Sometimes it creates unnecessary fear. Sometimes it creates false confidence.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 bg-sfm-cream/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-sfm-gold">
            <strong className="text-sfm-navy">The testing matters less than what happens after the testing.</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            That is why I only use genetic information within an ongoing relationship, where I can interpret results against everything else I know about a patient: their history, their labs, their family, their life.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8 bg-sfm-cream/50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-sfm-gold">
            <strong className="text-sfm-navy">Precision without continuity is just fragmentation with better marketing.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-display text-2xl md:text-3xl text-sfm-navy mt-12 mb-6">The Future of Primary Care Is Layered</h2>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">Modern primary care is becoming more precise. That is a good thing.</p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">But precision is not a replacement for relationship. It is an enhancement. This is similar to how <Link href="/blog/virtual-care-more-personal" className="text-sfm-azure hover:text-sfm-navy underline underline-offset-2 transition-colors">virtual care deepens relationships</Link> when done correctly.</p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4"><strong className="text-sfm-navy">The most effective model combines:</strong></p>

          <ul className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-8 space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Longitudinal knowledge of the patient</li>
            <li>Strong clinical reasoning</li>
            <li>Genetic and metabolic data used selectively</li>
            <li>A willingness to update the plan as new information emerges</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            This is how care moves from population averages to individualized strategy. Not by testing everything, but by testing the right things at the right time for the right reasons.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If you have been curious about whether genetic testing makes sense for you, the answer depends on your history, your goals, and what we are trying to understand.
